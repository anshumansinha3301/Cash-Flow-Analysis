Free cash flow (FCF) is often considered more reliable than earnings for several reasons, primarily due to its focus on actual cash generation and its resistance to manipulation. Here’s an overview of why FCF is valued over traditional earnings metrics:

### 1. **Reflects Actual Cash Generation**

Free cash flow represents the cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures necessary to maintain or expand its asset base. This means that FCF provides a clearer picture of the cash available for distribution to shareholders, reinvestment, or debt repayment. In contrast, earnings can include non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, which do not reflect the company's actual cash position. As a result, FCF is a more accurate measure of a company's financial health and operational efficiency [1][4].

### 2. **Less Susceptible to Accounting Manipulation**

Earnings figures can be easily manipulated through various accounting practices, such as aggressive revenue recognition or altering depreciation methods. Companies may also use accounting techniques to smooth earnings over time, making them appear more stable than they actually are. Free cash flow, being derived from actual cash transactions, is harder to manipulate. It reflects real cash movements, making it a more trustworthy metric for investors [3][4].

### 3. **Indicates Financial Flexibility**

FCF provides insights into a company’s financial flexibility. A business with strong free cash flow can invest in growth opportunities, pay dividends, reduce debt, or weather economic downturns without needing external financing. This flexibility is crucial for long-term sustainability and can enhance shareholder value. In contrast, companies that report high earnings but lack sufficient cash flow may struggle to fund their operations or growth initiatives [1][2].

### 4. **Focuses on Shareholder Value**

Investors are primarily concerned with the cash available for distribution to them—whether through dividends or share buybacks. Free cash flow directly addresses this concern by indicating how much cash is available after necessary expenditures. Companies with healthy FCF profiles are often viewed as better investments because they can return value to shareholders more reliably than those that rely solely on reported earnings [2][4].

### 5. **Better Indicator of Long-Term Performance**

FCF is a forward-looking metric that helps investors assess a company’s ability to generate sustainable profits over time. While earnings may fluctuate due to short-term factors or accounting adjustments, free cash flow tends to provide a more stable view of a company's operational performance and growth potential. This long-term perspective is valuable for investors looking to make informed decisions about holding or buying stocks [3][4].

### Conclusion

In summary, free cash flow is considered more reliable than earnings because it reflects actual cash generation, is less susceptible to manipulation, indicates financial flexibility, focuses on shareholder value, and serves as a better indicator of long-term performance. By prioritizing free cash flow in their analyses, investors can make more informed decisions regarding the financial health and potential of companies they are considering for investment.
